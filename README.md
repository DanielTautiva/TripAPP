## Description
This project implements the [W] API as a payment gateway. It includes basic registration and login functionalities with JWT and Bearer token to secure endpoints. Additionally, it features a credit card tokenizer, acceptance token, unique payment reference generator, and payment source ID. The implementation is based on NestJS with PostgreSQL and utilizes a Docker instance to simplify installation. Swagger is employed for local documentation of the application's endpoints.

## System Requirements
- Node.js 20.10.0
- PostgreSQL 16.1.0
- Docker 20.10.22
